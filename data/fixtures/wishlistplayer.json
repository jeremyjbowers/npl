Over three seasons at Miami, Rosario ran up a 6.47 ERA, hardly a precursor of pro success. The Rangers saw areas for improvement to his stuff and approach and drafted him in the fifth round in 2023. He debuted in 2024 and produced one of the best pitching years in the system. Once Rosario turned pro, the Rangers’ first move was to simplify his mix. He resurfaced the split-fingered fastball he had shelved in college and added it as the signature piece of a repertoire which also included a fastball and curveball. Texas also asked Rosario to use his fastball in the upper third of the strike zone and allow his two offspeed offerings to create a nasty north-south attack pattern. The final tweak involved moving him to the third-base side of the rubber in order to get a better angle on his stuff. The results were striking. Rosario bullied hitters at the lower levels and finished the year with a 33.1 K-BB% that led all minor league pitchers with at least 75 innings. He also pounded the zone relentlessly, finishing with a 68% strike rate across both Class A levels. In fact, Rosario found himself in just one 3-0 count all season. The only red flag on his season involved a shoulder impingement that delayed his arrival at Low-A Down East by a couple of weeks and kept him on a conservative pitch count in the early going. Rosario’s next step will be the upper levels, where he’ll face not only more advanced hitters but also extreme offensive environments in the Texas and Pacific Coast leagues.

The Tigers were careful with Hamm’s workload, and kept him at High-A West Michigan intentionally all season. His delivery is high energy with a significant trunk rotation at lay back and a long arm action that may be difficult to maintain. That leads some scouts to see him as an impact reliever in the long term, where his fastball will likely play up.

He rose from Low-A Salem to Double-A Portland and led the Red Sox system with 23 home runs.

The pitch garnered a miss rate north of 40%, and Chace backs it with a deep and varied pitch mix that has been tweaked as he’s matured. His current repertoire includes a short, hard slider, a sweeper and a changeup. The slider—which has the look of a cutter at times—is an effective offering against both righties and lefties and helps set up his sweeper for swings and misses. His changeup needs further development but has a chance to be average. Chace’s next step will be to turn his control into command, especially when it comes to pounding the zone early in counts. Chace performed nicely after changing organizations. He has the mix to remain in the rotation if he can raise the quality and volume of his strikes.

He shows an ability to hit the ball hard enough and at the right angles that above-average-to-plus power projection isn’t a stretch. The big question for Crisantes is where he fits defensively. His arm strength, which has improved as he’s gotten further removed from surgery, is fringy, and he is a little light on athleticism compared to the average major league second baseman. His makeup and work ethic are excellent, so he is a safe bet to keep improving to get the most out of his abilities. He is a fringe-average runner who is better once he gets up to speed. Crisantes’ bat will be his carrying tool and figures to play in some capacity almost no matter where he ends up on the diamond. The Diamondbacks believe he can develop into an offensive-minded second baseman.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 55, "player_risk": 2, "interesting": false, "stats": {"2023_minors_bat": {"2b": 7, "3b": 1, "hr": 1, "sb": 2, "avg": 0.346534653, "iso": 0.118811881, "obp": 0.417391304, "rbi": 14, "slg": 0.465346534, "hits": 35, "runs": 24, "side": "hit", "slug": "2023_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.4200204574543497, "year": "2023", "babip": 0.425, "k_pct": 18.2608695, "level": "CPX", "bb_pct": 9.565217299999999, "wrc_plus": 125, "plate_appearances": 115}, "2024_minors_bat": {"2b": 23, "3b": 6, "hr": 7, "sb": 30, "avg": 0.34054054, "iso": 0.151351351, "obp": 0.429223744, "rbi": 60, "slg": 0.491891891, "hits": 126, "runs": 89, "side": "hit", "slug": "2024_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.43141621105167843, "year": "2024", "babip": 0.396666666, "k_pct": 15.717539799999999, "level": "A,CPX", "bb_pct": 12.5284738, "wrc_plus": 143, "plate_appearances": 439}}}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 37, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:18:20.620Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T16:09:49.218Z", "player": "675085", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 19, "tier": null, "note": "A three-year starter at Long Beach State, Long’s career year in 2023 earned him second team All-Big West honors.

They’re drafted, they then quickly add velocity while also throwing plenty of strikes. In Morris’ case, he pitched three years at Colorado Mesa before transferring to Texas Tech, where he was the Friday starter in 2022. His fastball gained 2-3 mph since turning pro, and he leapt from High-A Cedar Rapids to Triple-A St. Paul in a three-month span in 2024.

Morris has no dominant pitch and doesn’t have true bat-missing stuff, but he has plus control and the ability to force hitters to protect the entire strike zone. He uses a very north-south approach. Morris’ 93-95 mph fringe-average fastball predominantly works up in the zone. Morris can reach back for 97-98, but it doesn’t have exceptional life. He works to his glove side with his above-average 84-86 mph slider, and then armside with a fringe-average 88-90 mph changeup that pairs well with his fastball and slider. Morris also added a hard, 90 mph above-average cutter, and he’ll drop in a fringe-average, slow, 12-to-6, mid-70s curveball as a way to steal early-count strikes, especially against lefthanded hitters. Morris throws everything for strikes, which helps him work deeper into games. Without ever topping 100 pitches, he worked six-plus innings 11 times in 24 starts in 2024. Morris is a perfect depth starter who should spend the majority of the 2025 season at Triple-A St. Paul but should be on call to fill in whenever needed. He will need to figure out a pitch to get more swings and misses to project as more than a No. 5 or up-and-down starter, but his control and pitch mix mean he’s ready to fill that role soon.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 45, "player_risk": 1, "interesting": true, "stats": {"2022_minors_pit": {"g": 1, "k": 1, "bb": 0, "gs": 0, "ha": 0, "ip": 1.0, "era": 0.0, "fip": 1.8252841949462892, "hra": 0, "k_9": 9.0, "bb_9": 0.0, "hr_9": 0.0, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2022_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 1.8252841949462892, "year": "2022", "hr_fb": 0.0, "level": "CPX", "gb_pct": 100.0, "lob_pct": 100.0}, "2023_minors_pit": {"g": 18, "k": 79, "bb": 19, "gs": 17, "ha": 86, "ip": 84.1, "era": 2.8814225773358157, "fip": 3.167321123810284, "hra": 4, "k_9": 8.430829022575164, "bb_9": 2.0276677396066853, "hr_9": 0.4268774188645653, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2023_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 3.4618551371213333, "year": "2023", "hr_fb": 0.059701492, "level": "A,A+", "gb_pct": 52.988047800000004, "lob_pct": 71.99211}, "2024_minors_pit": {"g": 26, "k": 133, "bb": 32, "gs": 24, "ha": 111, "ip": 133.0, "era": 2.3684207809080218, "fip": 2.857674957483646, "hra": 6, "k_9": 8.999998967450482, "bb_9": 2.1654132854016197, "hr_9": 0.40601499101280375, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2024_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 3.483789128214106, "year": "2024", "hr_fb": 0.050420168, "level": "A+,AA,AAA", "gb_pct": 45.054945000000004, "lob_pct": 75.757576}}}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 41, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:18:20.640Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:47:59.797Z", "player": "696030", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 22, "tier": null, "note": "Osuna is the nephew of former big league reliever Antonio Osuna and signed with the Rangers in October 2020.

Even if he does move to a corner—he bounced among all three outfield spots in 2024—his average, accurate arm would play.

His power plays to both sides of the park, and his 18 home runs were split nearly equally between both alleyways.

He has maintained his advance through the Royals’ system without hitting that imaginary wall. The Missouri native, who missed his junior season at Central Arkansas to Tommy John surgery, has performed consistently well at every level since first getting into minor league games in 2022, one year after being drafted in the seventh round. His nine starts at Triple-A Omaha to end 2024 represents the best run of his career, with a 2.32 ERA and 62 strikeouts to just 11 walks in 54.1 innings. A finesse lefthander with a sneaky four-seam fastball averaging 92 mph, Cameron excels because of the deceptive life on the pitch and its good vertical carry, helping to compensate for lower velocity. He added an extra tick of zip in 2024 and now touches 96 mph, and he may still have more in the tank. Cameron’s best secondary pitch is a plus low-80s changeup with good vertical separation off his fastball. It’s a deceptive pitch with big tumble, depth and command. Cameron has good feel for an above-average 78-83 mph curveball with 11-to-5 shape and tight break that he throws for strikes and tunnels well with the fastball. His fourth pitch is an 88-91 mph cutter with average horizontal movement. Cameron gets swings and misses from both his changeup and curve, and he’s a savvy hurler who mixes his pitches well.

The results, they hope, will show in a cleaner bat path and more impact on contact.

His first few seasons were milquetoast before a breakout 2024 campaign was catalyzed by a much better sense of the strike zone. He was added to Texas’ 40-man roster after the season, before being traded to Miami in the deal that made Jake Burger a Ranger.

The results were clear: He controlled the strike zone better—he struck out just 58 times in 104 games at Double-A—and showed more power. Part of the latter phenomenon was because he gained more balance and used his lower half better in his swing. He’s a sound defender up the middle who will fit nicely at either shortstop or second base and could move to third base in a pinch.

Wichrowski mixes four-seam and two-seam fastballs in what is typically an east-west attack, though he could miss more bats if he rides his fastball up in the zone more often. To miss bats, he throws a sharp slider with lateral break that flashes above-average potential. Wichrowski’s changeup has minimal separation from his fastball, meaning it’s not a pitch he uses often. While he’s not wild, his control was below-average, especially at Double-A, where his walk rate was 11%. If Wichrowski can hold the upper-level velocity he showed at the beginning of the year while also sharpening his command, he has the potential to be a midrotation starter.

Yoho has tight rotation on a 75-78 mph curveball that’s a tick above-average and breaks like a slider.

The delivery work helped his potentially plus 83 mph slider—which he throws with a foot of gloveside sweep—take another step forward.

He made just seven starts as a sophomore after having elbow surgery. Santucci logged a career-high 58 innings as the Blue Devils’ Friday night starter in 2024—he missed a month with a rib injury—and recorded high rates for both strikeouts (35%) and walks (14%). The Mets drafted Santucci in the second round and signed him for slot value of $2,031,700.

Throwing strikes with his four-seamer was a major challenge in college and contributed to walks and high pitch counts. Santucci’s 83-85 mph slider is an equalizer as a platoon-neutral weapon with late, two-plane break. He has had some success with a high-80s changeup but throws in sparingly. Making the proper adjustments in pro ball will be essential to iron out Santucci’s well below-average control. The Mets are toying with the idea of adding a sinker or cutter to his repertoire to seek more early-count, weak contact and avoid deep counts. Santucci’s fastball and slider give him potential major league weapons. Now, it’s a matter of finding the right complementary pitches and control to tie the package together.

After previously seeking a more consistent slider shape, Perkins added more sweep to his mid-80s offering to great results in 2024, with batters missing it roughly 45% of the time. His slider averaged nearly 2,800 rpm of spin, and the A’s now believe it’s one of the best breaking pitches in their system. The righthander also throws a solid low-90s cutter and a mid-80s curveball that he doesn’t command as consistently. Perkins sparingly mixes in a firm upper-80s changeup that needs more work. Perkins has a shorter arm path and fringe-average control. His past command concerns, walk rates and attacking mentality invite questions about whether he’ll ultimately shift to a relief role, but his strike rates in 2024 painted a more optimistic outlook. Perkins’ electric stuff and deep pitch mix provides a variety of paths to racking up outs.

He was hit hard in his first full season but blossomed in 2024, when he struck out 148 hitters in 106 innings and advanced to Double-A.

His fastball averaged 93.4 mph and was up to 97-98, and the progression to a harder slider in the high 80s over the course of the season gave him a better breaking ball.

Despite simplifying his operation, Moore’s results took a bit of a dip in his final season. Even so, the Rangers were drawn in by his high-end bat speed and the thump it could one day produce in the big leagues.

Cranton went to Low-A Modesto and struck out 14 batters in 8.1 innings in his pro debut. Cranton’s carrying trait is his massive fastball. It sits 96-99 mph but plays up due to its huge vertical ride. His fastball is a true swing-and-miss offering up in the zone versus either side. He pairs it with a hard and short, upper-80s slider that is more effective because it plays off of the big fastball than because of its own shape. Cranton has below-average command and is looking to get his pitches in the zone rather than pitching to specific quadrants.

He is a high-variance arm with a strong frame, durability and strike-throwing track record and chance at multiple plus offerings, but his violent delivery likely pushes him to relief.

He moved quickly by reaching the Florida Complex League later that season. Ullola made his full-season debut with Low-A Fayetteville in 2022, enjoying a breakout season with a 3.25 ERA in 72 innings. He struggled in 2023 at High-A Asheville, where his hitter-friendly home park made for a forgettable season. He handled the jump to Double-A with ease in 2024. Ullola made 23 starts with a 4.24 ERA and 166 strikeouts over 127.1 innings while posting the lowest walk rate of his career. He made one start following a promotion to Triple-A Sugar Land. A young righthander with premium stuff but very fringy command, Ullola has been able to hold on as a starter. He has free-and-easy mechanics, moderate arm action length and releases the ball from a high three-quarters slot. Ullola gets above-average extension with a lower release height that generates ride and a flatter plane to the plate. Ullola’s fastball sits 93-95 mph and peaks at 98 with some cut and 18-20 inches of induced vertical break. His fastball is plus-plus and generates swing-and-miss at an elite rate. Ullola’s primary secondary is his slider with cutter shape that sits 87-88 mph, touches 90 and has been marked both as a slider and cutter by ball-tracking systems. It’s a solid bat-misser that generates weak contact. Ullola also mixes a low-80s curveball and an upper-80s changeup. Both pitches see increased usage against lefthanded hitters.

The Yankees got him as an undrafted free agent after two years at Rio Hondo Junior College outside Los Angeles. Flores was playing with the Alaska Goldpanners when the Yankees signed him in July 2022. He hit the ground running as a pro and has been one of the system’s most productive players over the past two years, including a system-best 21 home runs in 2024 while playing for High-A Hudson Valley and Double-A Somerset. His season earned him the nod as Baseball America’s Yankees minor league player of the year. Flores hits the ball as hard as nearly anybody in the system. His 90th percentile and maximum exit velocities of 108.1 and 115.2 mph each ranked second in the organization. There’s plenty of swing-and-miss in there as well, and scouts noted that Flores will expand the zone against high fastballs or breaking balls down and away. Those traits will likely lead to a future as a below-average hitter with above-average thump. Flores spent roughly three-quarters of his defensive reps behind the plate in 2024 and was at first base for the remainder of the time. Scouts saw enough improvement behind the dish to label him as a potentially fringe-average defender, though he’s still a bit stiff back there, and his throws have too much tail. He caught just 13% of basestealers. Flores has bottom-end speed and will not be much of a factor on the bases. Other scouts like him better at first base, where his big frame helps his lateral range and provides a big target for throws. Triple-A will be a big test for Flores in 2025. Savvy arms at the level will be able to exploit holes in his swing and force him to adjust.

Pitre is a complementary player, who doesn’t have middle-of-the-order potential, but his ability to be an above-average defender at second base with a plus hit tool could make him a very useful top or bottom of the lineup regular. His plus speed plays well on the basepaths, where he swiped 20 or more bases in his final two seasons at Kentucky. He nabbed seven in nine tries in just 21 pro games. Defensively, he’s rangier than the average second baseman, especially to his right, as he very comfortably makes plays on the shortstop side of the bag. He is quick on double play turns and throws accurately on the run, although his average arm would be a drawback if he tried to fill in at shortstop.

He has the pitch mix and arm talent to be a midrotation starter if everything clicks. He has a lively four-seam fastball that sits 94-96 mph and can touch the high 90s. His 82-84 mph gyro-slider has some depth and power, and he pairs it with a cutter. He’s shown a bigger, slower curve in the past as well. His split-change is the one pitch that needs further development. Hall pitched a little in the bridge leagues, but 2025 will mark his official pro debut. He’s ready for Low-A Lakeland, where he should be one of the best arms in the league.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 50, "player_risk": 3, "interesting": false, "stats": null}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 135, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:21:21.897Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:48:00.369Z", "player": "811289", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 103, "tier": null, "note": "The Royals’ 2023 fifth-round pick from Missouri State started slowly in his first full season, until exploding in August with a batting line of 1.233 OPS with 13 home runs.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": null, "player_risk": null, "interesting": false, "stats": {"2023_minors_bat": {"2b": 7, "3b": 0, "hr": 2, "sb": 8, "avg": 0.201754385, "iso": 0.114035088, "obp": 0.338129496, "rbi": 8, "slg": 0.315789473, "hits": 23, "runs": 15, "side": "hit", "slug": "2023_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.3252934912125841, "year": "2023", "babip": 0.23076923, "k_pct": 15.827338099999999, "level": "A,CPX", "bb_pct": 17.266187, "wrc_plus": 91, "plate_appearances": 139}, "2024_minors_bat": {"2b": 18, "3b": 3, "hr": 21, "sb": 7, "avg": 0.25136612, "iso": 0.237704918, "obp": 0.341232227, "rbi": 61, "slg": 0.489071038, "hits": 92, "runs": 59, "side": "hit", "slug": "2024_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.37842405054744804, "year": "2024", "babip": 0.300847457, "k_pct": 26.7772511, "level": "A+,CPX", "bb_pct": 11.8483412, "wrc_plus": 133, "plate_appearances": 422}}}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 136, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:21:21.901Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:48:00.373Z", "player": "801573", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 99, "tier": null, "note": "A Southern California native, Forcucci spent three years at UC San Diego.

Messina is an average runner who will give you the surprisingly plus run time every so often, though he’s not much of a basestealing threat. Behind the plate Messina moves well and has a chance to be an above-average defender with good framing and blocking and an above-average arm. Messina has a chance to develop into an everyday catcher if he proves he can hit. Overall, he has a wide range of potential outcomes.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 45, "player_risk": 2, "interesting": false, "stats": {"2024_minors_bat": {"2b": 1, "3b": 0, "hr": 1, "sb": 0, "avg": 0.14, "iso": 0.08, "obp": 0.232142857, "rbi": 6, "slg": 0.22, "hits": 7, "runs": 1, "side": "hit", "slug": "2024_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.22405724227428436, "year": "2024", "babip": 0.157894736, "k_pct": 19.6428571, "level": "A+", "bb_pct": 8.928571400000001, "wrc_plus": 33, "plate_appearances": 56}}}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 146, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:21:21.943Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:48:00.431Z", "player": "800406", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 114, "tier": null, "note": "Estrada was a Dominican Summer League all-star in 2022 after signing for just $150,000, and while he had to earn his way onto the Low-A Delmarva roster out of camp in 2024, he ended up being the first hitter promoted from that roster with a .795 OPS in 91 games.

In his early days, the pitch sat around 88-90 mph. Now, the pitch averages 94 and touches 97 with 15 inches of induced vertical break. The shorter, harder slider is the most recent addition to his mix and serves as a complement to the sweepier version, which is his money pitch. Both his curveball and changeup are fringy, and he grades as an average strike-thrower. Schlittler has overhauled his delivery in recent years to transfer his weight better as he moves down the mound.

Kemp is one of the smartest baserunners in the organization and gets the most out of speed that is only fringe-average. He mostly toggled back and forth between second and third base at each of his stops in 2024, while also mixing in occasional time at first base and right field. Scouts peg him as a potentially average defender with a solid-average arm that would fit at either of his two main spots on the diamond. Kemp will likely return to Triple-A Lehigh Valley to begin 2025. If he produces, he’ll have a chance to make his big league debut.

He loves to swing the bat, which leads him to chase pitches. Lomavita has a huge personality, which has helped in his catching role. He controls a game with authority and makes pitchers feel more at ease during big moments. He does not look out of place behind the dish despite being relatively new to the position. Lomavita’s arm strength is above-average, and he has strong hands, both of which are qualities that should make him an asset behind the plate. Lomavita has plenty of development ahead of him, but scouts praise his work ethic and willingness to put in the work to improve.

He has performed at every level as a pro, with a 2.97 ERA, a near 29% strikeout rate and a 1.01 WHIP in 109 innings between High-A Aberdeen and Double-A Bowie in 2024. In an Orioles system of hoppy heaters, Weston stands out for his 91-94 mph two-seamer, which is an effective pitch that generates weak contact from his low three-quarters slot. The delivery creates deception, but Weston’s formula for success also includes above-average control and consistent execution of the rest of his arsenal. He misses bats with an above-average high-70s sweeping slider, and has a changeup with tons of fade against lefthanded hitters and a distinct splitter as a weapon against righties. That arsenal plays up because of Weston’s ability to command it and overall knowledge of pitching, as he demonstrates a plan in-game and executes his pitches. Weston excelled in both starting and relieving roles in the Orioles’ tandem system, and has the makeup to succeed in either. Weston will need to execute at the level he has to keep him on the path to be a back-end starter, though his arm slot and ability to attack hitters could lend itself to a long and successful relief career.

He also has a developing slider and changeup, with athleticism to repeat his delivery and develop control. Offensively, Cason has raw all-fields power and generates exit velocities in excess of 100 mph along with good plate discipline. He still needs to develop a defined swing to limit his swing-and-miss. His defensive actions are smooth and he has plenty of arm for shortstop. He also shows the aptitude to follow a challenging development path. If ever there was a player to dream on, it’s Cason.

He pitched well early but dealt with control issues as the season progressed. While the results weren’t what anyone would have hoped down the stretch, De Leon’s stuff remained consistent and high-level throughout the year. He pitches off a heavy 94-97 mph fastball that hitters beat into the ground and a potentially above-average changeup that remains effective in the high 80s. Those pitches, plus a harder slider, make for a strong overall repertoire that generates high groundball rates—61% in 2024—and solid whiff rates. De Leon is athletic but is still finding a repeatable delivery and release point, which at this point translates to below-average control and inconsistent command. De Leon’s pitch mix from the left side is one that organizations try to keep in the rotation as long as possible, given that he could be a midrotation starter with more consistency, though his is a high relief floor.

He has real power with some of the better exit velocities in the Twins system, but he also struggles to catch up to velocity and doesn’t have great pitch recognition. Camargo is capable of handling a big league staff defensively, as he works well with pitchers, brings plenty of energy and has developed into an above-average receiver and framer. He has a plus arm as well. His lack of plate discipline makes it unlikely he can ever slide into an everyday role.

Healthy again in 2024, he threw 136.2 total innings—nearly matching his innings total from the previous two years combined—and made his big league debut, going 1-1, 4.24 with 29 strikeouts in 34 innings. Ginn’s resurgence was keyed by his return to full strength. The righthander pitched with better extension, and his above-average command resurfaced after a scattershot 2023. Ginn has two separate fastballs that average 92-93 mph, although his sinker is the superior offering and racks up ground balls. The A’s implored him to trust the sinker more as the season progressed, and he utilized his four-seamer sparingly in his big league debut. Ginn’s best swing-and-miss offering is a solid-average mid-80s slider that he leans on roughly 30% of the time, although he can occasionally lose feel for it. He’ll also mix in an 86-88 mph changeup to elicit whiffs and chase against lefties. Ginn is a solid athlete, repeats his delivery well and should throw plenty of strikes in the future. Ginn’s command and tidy pitch mix sets a high floor even if his lack of power may limit his ceiling.

They added and then dropped him from the 40-man roster in 2023. He struggled early in the 2024 season at Triple-A Toledo, but after walking nine in 13 innings in May, he found the strike zone and struck out 27 without a walk in June and July. Added to the MLB roster in August, he immediately became part of the bullpen and pitched 1.2 scoreless innings in the playoffs. Hanifee didn’t make any massive changes to his pitch mix or his delivery to transform his season. He just started locating better. He proved to be one of the epitomes of the Tigers’ approach, as he forced hitters to defend all quadrants of the the strike zone thanks to his ability to work armside and up with his 95-96 mph four-seam fastball, his 86-88 mph slider to the gloveside bottom of the zone, his 87-88 mph changeup to the arm-side bottom of the zone and a 93-95 mph sinker to the bottom third of the zone.

He’s moved quickly through the minor leagues, skipped Low-A entirely and reached Triple-A in 2024. The Dodgers added him to their 40-man roster in November to shield him from the Rule 5 draft. Dreyer is a pure relief prospect and hasn’t made a single start in 100 minor league appearances. He works primarily with two pitches: a mid-90s fastball that peaked at 96 mph and a mid-80s slider with sharp, devastating break toward the feet of righthanders. He also mixed in the occasional curveball in the high 70s. The fastball featured nearly 19 inches of induced vertical break and racked up a miss rate of 29%. His slider was even more successful and got misses at a 36% clip. The curveball was more of a change of pace offering. The biggest reason for Dreyer’s leap forward was because his control took a giant leap forward. In 2023, he walked more than six hitters per nine innings. In 2024, he walked just 12 hitters in 57.1 innings and raised his strike rate by 8%. Dreyer is a ready-made big leaguer and will likely get his first look at Los Angeles in 2025.

Castano was originally a low-dollar sign by New York in 2018 out of the Dominican Republic. He has been solid if unspectacular at every level with the Yankees and Mariners, reaching Triple-A in both 2023 and 2024. Seattle added Castano to its 40-man roster in November. Castano has both started and relieved throughout his career, and he always pitches out of the stretch. His repertoire is deep enough to start, with four pitches and weapons for hitters of either hand. His sinker sits 92-95 mph with plenty of armside run, and he will also mix in the occasional four-seamer up in the zone. Castano pairs it with a cutter that he likes to spot in on the hands of lefties. He also has a softer breaking ball, a sweeping slider, that he uses for whiff. He rounds out his arsenal with a firm changeup that is effective more for its late fade than for its velocity separation. His changeup will flash above-average at times and is the best of his secondaries when at its best. Castano is generally around the zone, and will show average command, with the ability to pitch backward at times. However, he will get cute around the edges, leading to slightly elevated walk rates. As a 40-man roster player, he will have multiple opportunities to contribute MLB innings in 2025. He is a jack-of-all-trades who is capable of starting, long relieving or one-inning stints. His ceiling is as a back-end starter, but his more likely outcome is as a do-everything swingman.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 40, "player_risk": 1, "interesting": false, "stats": {"2021_minors_bat": {"2b": 0, "3b": 0, "hr": 0, "sb": 0, "avg": 0.0, "iso": 0.0, "obp": 0.0, "rbi": 0, "slg": 0.0, "hits": 0, "runs": 0, "side": "hit", "slug": "2021_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.0, "year": "2021", "babip": 0.0, "k_pct": 0.0, "level": "A", "bb_pct": 0.0, "wrc_plus": -100, "plate_appearances": 0}, "2021_minors_pit": {"g": 10, "k": 55, "bb": 10, "gs": 8, "ha": 48, "ip": 45.1, "era": 4.169118114821279, "fip": 2.862305205885155, "hra": 2, "k_9": 10.919118872150968, "bb_9": 1.985294340391085, "hr_9": 0.397058868078217, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2021_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 3.0641627406923426, "year": "2021", "hr_fb": 0.076923076, "level": "A,CPX", "gb_pct": 52.5, "lob_pct": 65.292096}, "2022_minors_pit": {"g": 22, "k": 103, "bb": 34, "gs": 21, "ha": 106, "ip": 107.1, "era": 3.857143104182177, "fip": 4.502329320280808, "hra": 12, "k_9": 8.636646515886179, "bb_9": 2.8509318596129134, "hr_9": 1.0062112445692637, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2022_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 4.653134994113057, "year": "2022", "hr_fb": 0.103448275, "level": "A+,AA", "gb_pct": 41.118421, "lob_pct": 70.484581}, "2023_minors_pit": {"g": 26, "k": 75, "bb": 35, "gs": 11, "ha": 71, "ip": 78.1, "era": 4.365957717006177, "fip": 4.581911336376407, "hra": 8, "k_9": 8.617021809880612, "bb_9": 4.021276844610952, "hr_9": 0.9191489930539319, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2023_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 4.569388711865875, "year": "2023", "hr_fb": 0.115942028, "level": "AA,AAA", "gb_pct": 48.5849056, "lob_pct": 68.70229}, "2024_minors_pit": {"g": 29, "k": 108, "bb": 43, "gs": 26, "ha": 129, "ip": 125.1, "era": 4.380319326697789, "fip": 4.760223514818234, "hra": 15, "k_9": 7.755319463661659, "bb_9": 3.087766082754179, "hr_9": 1.0771277032863416, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2024_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 4.606363556704069, "year": "2024", "hr_fb": 0.135135135, "level": "AA,AAA", "gb_pct": 53.494623600000004, "lob_pct": 68.94409900000001}}}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 190, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:22:26.341Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:48:00.661Z", "player": "680672", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 304, "tier": null, "note": "Waddell lacks big league tools and size as a 5-foot-7, 180-pound infielder and lefthanded hitter, but he’s a savvy ballplayer who makes a ton of contact and can reliably play all over the infield.

He responded well, pitching to a 1.61 ERA with 33 strikeouts in 28 innings from July 20 on while reaching Triple-A. The A’s added him to their 40-man roster after the season. Cusick struggled to sustain the requisite touch-and-feel—or a consistent changeup—necessary to remain in a starting role. The A’s hope the velocity on his mid-90s fastball, which touched triple digits regularly in college but waxed and waned over the last two years, will tick back up now that he’s unencumbered in shorter doses. At his best, Cusick can overpower hitters with velocity and decent carry on his four-seamer. He threw both an upper-80s slider and low-80s curve in a starting role, but he’ll likely prioritize the above-average gyro slider in relief. He also occasionally mixed in a cutter in 2024. Cusick is a below-average strike-thrower. Opportunities are aplenty in the A’s bullpen entering 2025.

Schwartz worked around a shoulder injury in 2021 to hit .396 to win the Pacific-12 Conference batting title. The Mets drafted him in the fourth round that year, drawn to his hitting skill and discipline. Schwartz is a hit-over-power first baseman coming off a career-best power year in 2024. He hit 10 home runs with a .143 isolated slugging percentage in a season split between Double-A Binghamton and Triple-A Syracuse. He did most of his damage at Double-A, but his expected metrics were similar at Triple-A, and he finished on a high note with four homers and a .271 ISO in September. Schwartz has uncanny bat-to-ball skill. His 15.9% strikeout rate was fifth-lowest among minor league first basemen in 2024 who batted at least 400 times, while his 12% zone-miss rate was a top 40 figure among upper-level hitters. He takes his walks and has a career .363 on-base percentage. Schwartz is an adequate first baseman and ordinary runner for the position.

As far back as the 2020 instructional league, his arm speed and exceptional velocity stood out, but it was hard to see it in the results.

But Mey, while still wild, made big strides harnessing his fastball in 2024, reaching Double-A and earning a spot on the Reds’ 40-man roster after the season. There aren’t a dozen pitchers in baseball who throw harder than Mey. He topped out at 103 mph and sat 97-99 mph in most outings with a sinker that lives in the bottom half of the zone. He has largely junked the four-seamer he used to throw regularly. When Mey is locating both his fastball and either his 84-86 mph slider or harder high-80s cutter, hitters have little chance. The good news for batters is he struggles to string together innings where he has feel for two pitches. Mey’s control has improved significantly, but it remains well below-average. Of the 244 batters he faced in 2024, he allowed only six doubles and no triples or home runs. Opponents slugged .228 against him. Righties hit .131/.321/.159. Mey has the makings of a dominating reliever, but it’s taken him six pro seasons to get to the point where he’s not walking everyone. Even now, his control leads to some truly horrid outings.

He blew out his elbow in the spring of 2019, then was cut in 2020. He pitched in independent leagues until the Red Sox plucked him from the Pioneer League in late 2023. He impressed enough in four starts to garner a stint in the Arizona Fall League and followed that with an excellent performance as a starter in Double-A in 2024. He earned a quick promotion to Triple-A Worcester but missed two months due to shin inflammation. He showed impressive stuff in a season-ending run in the bullpens of Triple-A Worcester and ultimately Boston. Penrod works in the mid 90s as a starter but topped out at 99 mph in Triple-A and 97 mph in the big leagues as a reliever. His fastball command is spotty. He does a good job selling hitters on a changeup with 15 inches of armside run and fade, while also throwing a work-in-progress slider, particularly to lefties.

Pineda is a solid defender in right field, where he covers plenty of ground and has a strong arm. He’s also spent time at first base, but his hard hands and poor range make him better suited for the grass. He is a below-average runner but is willing to bust it down the line if he smells a hit.

It was Owens’ second trade in seven months after he had been traded to the Rangers from the Braves in January 2024 for outfielder J.P. Martinez. Owens bounced between starting and relieving with the Braves, but he’s now fully focused on relieving. That is his best fit, as his fastball gained another couple of ticks—he touched 100 mph in 2024. Owens combines premium velocity and plus control, which he manages to do despite an extremely long arm action which starts with a big plunge. He started working on a splitter as a Tiger, which gives him another platoon-neutral pitch to go with his plus slider. The Tigers emphasize that pitchers need to have plans to retire lefties and righties, and Owens checks that box. When the Tigers added Owens to the 40-man roster during the offseason, they almost certainly ensured he’ll pitch in the majors in 2025.

Gusto has a starter’s build, a deep repertoire of pitches and advanced pitchability. Gusto’s arsenal consists of a four-seam fastball, slider, curveball, cutter and a changeup. His four-seam fastball sits 92-94 mph and touches 98 mph at peak with average ride. His low-80s sweeper slider is his most used secondary, averaging around 10-12 inches of horizontal break. The changeup is Gusto’s best pitch, a mid-80s offering with above-average armside run, sold with arm speed and good vertical separation off of the fastball. Gusto uses his curveball as his primary breaking ball vs. lefties and ups his cutter usage against righties. It’s truly a kitchen sink approach as Gusto keeps hitters guessing with his sequencing and shows above-average command.

He worked his way up to Triple-A in the Mets system before being dealt to the Mariners at the 2024 trade deadline for reliever Ryne Stanek. Thomas finished the season strong, hitting .322 for Tacoma after the trade. Thomas’ carrying trait at the plate is a freakish contact rate. He uses a short lefthanded swing and is extremely unlikely to whiff. He will jailbreak out of the box when he sniffs an infield hit, and has enough speed to beat some of them out. However, Thomas often doesn’t finish his swing, and he carries well below-average power. He projects as a high average, lower walk rate, low slugging bat. His solid-average run tool doesn’t play great on the basepaths. He has just 30 career stolen bases at a 62.5% success rate in more than 200 career games. However, his speed plays way up in the outfield, where he is a well above-average net defender due to his outstanding jumps, routes and instincts in right field. He also closes well on the ball and is nifty around the wall. He has a below-average arm that can be taken advantage of—unless he has a runway to throw. His defensive tools fit best in center field. Despite not being a burner, Thomas profiles as a defense-first outfielder off the bench.

Sometimes, though, he gets overanxious, leading to poor pitch selection and whiff concerns. He needs to fix his approach to limit mistakes that lead to easy outs. He has solid strength and plus bat speed despite his diminutive frame with sneaky pop and solid exit velocities. He lacks the arm for shortstop but his range and actions—particularly tracking while going backward—make him an above-average defender at second base. He is an instinctual baserunner with below-average speed. Still just 21 years old entering 2025, Placencia needs a better plan at the plate to tap into his offensive potential.

In 2024, Roddery pitched in the majors with the Marlins while Rolddy posted a 4.24 ERA as a reliever with High-A Rome and Double-A Mississippi. His 34.6% strikeout rate was the best of any Braves minor leaguer with 50 innings. After the season, the Braves added him to the 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. A 6-foot-2, 183-pound righthander, Muñoz is a no-doubt reliever with a well-developed frame and lengthy, but fluid arm path. He throws both a four-seam and two-seam fastball that both sit 97-98 mph and touch 100 consistently, with the two-seamer being the more effective fastball shape of the two. His hellacious upper-80s slider is his go-to offering, boasting an excellent combination of power and movement. Among minor league sliders and sweepers that averaged at least 88 mph in 2024, Muñoz’s 10 inches of glove-side movement was some of the most in the game. It’s a lethal breaking ball with snappy biting action that helped him drive nearly a 25% swinging strike rate and pops on Stuff+ models. Muñoz is a below-average strike-thrower with a 10.7% career walk rate. Muñoz looks like a big league reliever and being added to the 40-man roster could give him an opportunity in 2025.

His low-80s slider features slurvy shape and is his best performing pitch from a swing-and-miss perspective with a 20.5% swinging strike rate. Sanders shows great feel for his changeup and it might have the highest upside of any pitch in his arsenal. He shows two variations of the pitch, a traditional changeup and a split-changeup version with more dynamic tumble.

It’s at its best on the armside and/or in the top-half of the zone. Baez’s upper-70s-to-low-80s curveball lacks teeth and its shape is inconsistent, but it’s his best swing-and-miss pitch. At times it will have serious depth and have a true 12-to-6 look, while at others it will have more of a slurvy shape with two-plane break. His split-change is a nice change-of-pace off his fastball and he throws it with conviction. Baez does a nice job of maintaining his arm speed and the changeup will flash late drop with some armside fade. He has above-average command and is consistently around the strike zone.

In all, he hit .252/.357/.403 with 13 homers, though the Pirates left him unprotected ahead of the Rule 5 Draft. The lefthanded-hitting Alfonzo is athletic and powerfully-built with above-average power potential. He began accessing that power more consistently with modest improvements to his launch angles. Alfonzo improved his 106.4 mph 90th percentile exit velocity by nearly 4 mph compared to 2023. He has above-average bat speed and makes plenty of contact on pitches in the zone. Alfonzo is fairly patient—he did swing and chase a bit more in 2024—and handles velocity well, although his swing can be susceptible to elevated fastballs. Defensively, Alfonzo is an above-average thrower who needs to continue to improve his receiving and is lauded internally for his work with pitchers. He split his time between catcher and first base in Greensboro. Alfonzo has an attractive combination of power and contact skills—especially if he continues to lift the ball more—even if better pitchers test his passivity.

He has always missed plenty of bats, but it’s come with missing the strike zone. In 2024, he posted a 2.04 ERA in 53 innings between High-A Rome and Double-A Mississippi with a 34.1% strikeout rate and 12.6% walk rate. The Braves left him exposed to the Rule 5 draft after the season. Joseph is a powerfully-built righthander with a strong and filled-out 6-foot, 200-pound frame. He has a fast, loose arm action and throws from a three-quarters slot. Joseph is a two-pitch pitcher with some of the best pure stuff in Atlanta’s system. He averaged 97 mph with his four-seam fastball and has been up to 100 with solid riding life and a flat approach angle that helps the pitch collect tons of whiffs at the top of the zone. Control could be the only thing holding it back from a 70-grade projection. Joseph threw a mid-80s, high-spin slider more than half the time in 2024 and used the pitch to generate a 20.2% swinging-strike rate with a great combination of movement and power that dominated righties but was also effective vs. lefties.

His junior year he threw out more than 50% of basestealers and hit .289 with 14 home runs after hitting under .200 with just four combined home runs in his first two college seasons. Burns’ defense draws the kind of praise that is almost never said about a Class A catcher. The Reds brought him to MLB spring training and quickly found that big league pitchers asked to throw to him. His defense is MLB-ready right now thanks to exceptional hands, excellent pitch framing and a plus-plus arm. But Burns has one flaw that could stand in the way of a lengthy MLB career—he hasn’t shown he can hit. After an inconsistent offensive career in college his first full pro season in 2024 raised more concerns. He has average raw power, but struggles to catch up to velocity and is beaten by breaking balls and struck out 34% of the time.

However, he picked up pitching in his senior season, adding enough intrigue to his profile to be drafted by the Mariners in the sixth round in 2024. Reportedly, the Mariners plan to use him as a two-way player in pro ball. On the mound, Knipp pitches off of a straight 93-96 mph fastball with downhill angle. He pairs it with a power, two-plane 81-84 mph curveball. He was around the zone quite a bit in his small pitching sample, especially for how little mound experience he had. Offensively, Knipp’s calling card is plus raw power. He uses a grooved swing without a ton of adjustability, meaning that he lacks the plate coverage to get to balls down or away. He offsets it somewhat with his above-average plate discipline. Behind the plate, he has a plus-plus arm. However, he struggles to throw out opposing basestealers because he has a slower transfer and often airmails his throws. Knipp also is rough in the receiving and blocking departments. He has an awkward, heavy gait, but his top speed is respectable despite poor acceleration. Knipp is an interesting player to project. He doesn’t have a clearly defined role as either a hitter or a pitcher, but there’s enough potential in both to squint to see some sort of path to an MLB roster.

He overhauled his slider, going from a low-80s slurve to an upper-80s slider that now flashes solid-average potential. Scouts like his feel to fade his upper-80s changeup when he trusts it. Dotel still struggles at times to harness and sequence his arsenal to put hitters away, leading evaluators to wonder whether he’s ultimately better suited in the bullpen. Dotel’s pitching style and career arc so far are similar to former Pirates righthander Luis Ortiz, who broke into the majors as a reliever before carving out a role in the back of Pittsburgh’s rotation.

His 1.88 ERA was the best in the minor leagues and his 113 strikeouts ranked ninth in the system. Nothing in Davalillo’s arsenal jumps out as a true plus pitch, but nothing in his mix is worse than fringe-average. His fastball sits around 93 mph and touches 96, and he switched its shape from four-seam to two-seam as the season wore on. Davalillo’s best offspeed is his split-changeup. The pitch garnered a 57.8% miss rate, the highest of any part of his repertoire. He throws two distinct breaking balls: a curveball in the mid 70s and a sweeper in the low 80s. Both pitches earned fringe-average grades from scouts. He pounded the zone with his entire arsenal and walked just 32 hitters in 110.1 innings. His results didn’t skip a beat after the move to High-A, a fact scouts inside and outside the organization attribute to his cerebral nature and excellent feel to pitch. After a breakout season, Davalillo will reach Double-A for the first time in 2025.

Over 46 relief appearances split evenly between Low-A and High-A, Herrera struck out 92 batters and walked 23 across 62.1 innings. Herrera was selected as a Low-A California League all-star after the season. Herrera is an undersized lefthander with a four-pitch mix who’s adept at missing bats and driving grounders. Herrera mixes a four-seam fastball and sinker that sit 93-95 mph and touch 97 mph at peak. He generates lots of ground balls with both fastball shapes and his slider, a low-to-mid-80s gyroball. His changeup wasn’t used much in 2024 but is a standard changeup in the mid-80s. Herrera generates whiffs with both his fastball and slider with the latter doing a great job of generating chases. Herrera shows above-average command of his fastball and slider and shows average strike-throwing abilities.

The Pirates may explore creating more distinction between the two pitches. He rounds out his arsenal with a seldom-used upper-80s changeup. Ercolani’s command, durability and ability to hold velocity throughout his starts waxed and waned at times, heightening concerns he may one day move to the bullpen.

Ager is an interesting projection candidate given his starter traits and room to add more strength onto his 6-foot-6 frame. He relied heavily on his fastball-slider combination in college.

Ager also mixed in a slower, loopier mid-70s curveball and a mid-80s changeup at times. Scouts generally liked his easy, repeatable delivery, although the Pirates believed some of his injury woes negatively impacted his mechanics and strike-throwing compared to 2023.

The Yankees drafted Cunningham with the 53rd pick in 2024 and signed him for $2,297,500, roughly $600,000 over slot. He did not pitch after signing and will make his professional debut in 2025. The Yankees prioritized pitching in the 2024 draft, waiting until the eighth round to select their first position player. The group could mostly be described with two adjectives: physical and college-educated. At 6-foot-5 and 234 pounds, Cunningham perfectly fits the bill. His fastball comfortably sits in the mid 90s and has touched 99 mph. He backed it up with a slider thrown in the mid 80s and a changeup that runs a couple ticks hotter. His changeup—which has unusually high spin rates—was Cunningham’s best offspeed pitch in 2024. Previously, that role was filled by his slider, which at its best shows the kind of two-plane break ideal for inducing swings and misses. Cunningham ties his mix together with potentially-average control, but his command—especially of his offspeed pitches—needs to improve if he is to remain a rotation candidate. Cunningham has the physicality and stuff to overwhelm hitters.

When he’s off, as he was after the trade, his posture slouches and he pops up pitches he typically would drive. Cowles does an excellent job of manipulating the barrel and his true gift is his ability to square up the ball and optimize ball flight. He also crushes breaking balls. Cowles is an average runner who shows burst once underway, though he’s unlikely to steal more than 20 bases in a season. Cowles is a fringe-average defender and thrower who spent time at shortstop, second and third base in 2024. Cowles’ addition to the 40-man roster and defensive versatility suggest he should see some MLB time in 2025.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 40, "player_risk": 1, "interesting": false, "stats": {"2021_minors_bat": {"2b": 7, "3b": 1, "hr": 4, "sb": 1, "avg": 0.25, "iso": 0.201923076, "obp": 0.352459016, "rbi": 25, "slg": 0.451923076, "hits": 26, "runs": 14, "side": "hit", "slug": "2021_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.3747233958517919, "year": "2021", "babip": 0.379310344, "k_pct": 35.2459016, "level": "A,CPX", "bb_pct": 10.6557377, "wrc_plus": 118, "plate_appearances": 122}, "2022_minors_bat": {"2b": 18, "3b": 4, "hr": 7, "sb": 14, "avg": 0.271523178, "iso": 0.155629139, "obp": 0.374647887, "rbi": 41, "slg": 0.427152317, "hits": 82, "runs": 47, "side": "hit", "slug": "2022_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.3750389458427966, "year": "2022", "babip": 0.386597938, "k_pct": 29.0140845, "level": "A,A+", "bb_pct": 12.112676, "wrc_plus": 130, "plate_appearances": 355}, "2023_minors_bat": {"2b": 18, "3b": 2, "hr": 10, "sb": 23, "avg": 0.253263707, "iso": 0.135770235, "obp": 0.353200883, "rbi": 41, "slg": 0.389033942, "hits": 97, "runs": 62, "side": "hit", "slug": "2023_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.3441946249923959, "year": "2023", "babip": 0.343873517, "k_pct": 28.035320000000002, "level": "A+,AAA", "bb_pct": 12.1412803, "wrc_plus": 106, "plate_appearances": 453}, "2024_minors_bat": {"2b": 25, "3b": 3, "hr": 9, "sb": 14, "avg": 0.286135693, "iso": 0.171091445, "obp": 0.372151898, "rbi": 51, "slg": 0.457227138, "hits": 97, "runs": 54, "side": "hit", "slug": "2024_minors_bat", "type": "minors", "woba": 0.37637137793287445, "year": "2024", "babip": 0.330827067, "k_pct": 17.7215189, "level": "AA", "bb_pct": 10.3797468, "wrc_plus": 137, "plate_appearances": 395}}}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 301, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:22:26.859Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:48:01.175Z", "player": "701519", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 312, "tier": null, "note": "The biggest moment of Adams’ 2024 season didn’t come on the field.

He was promoted to Triple-A St. Paul after posting a 0.70 ERA in five August outings. The Twins added him to the 40-man roster after the season. Adams didn’t dramatically change anything to turn his season and career around, he just pitched better with roughly the same stuff, the same pitch mix and the same control. Adams doesn’t really have a plus pitch, but he has an array of average offerings, starting with a mid-90s four-seam fastball and an above-average, hard cutter at 90-91 mph that he relies on heavily. He also has a mid-80s slider and an 86-88 mph changeup. His ability to mix pitches with average control is paired with solid durability. He has topped 100 innings each of the past three seasons and the last time he missed significant time was as a freshman at Sacramento State, when he was shut down in early May for precautionary reasons. Adams heads back to St. Paul as an on-call starter, but his fastball, cutter and slider paired with an ability to throw strikes also makes him a useful prospective big league reliever who can throw multiple innings while being optioned back and forth as needed.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 40, "player_risk": 1, "interesting": false, "stats": {"2021_minors_pit": {"g": 1, "k": 3, "bb": 2, "gs": 1, "ha": 2, "ip": 1.1, "era": 20.250050090377258, "fip": 4.148394775390625, "hra": 0, "k_9": 20.250050090377258, "bb_9": 13.500033393584838, "hr_9": 0.0, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2021_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 5.8095403581882525, "year": "2021", "hr_fb": 0.0, "level": "CPX", "gb_pct": 33.3333333, "lob_pct": 25.0}, "2022_minors_pit": {"g": 22, "k": 108, "bb": 26, "gs": 22, "ha": 91, "ip": 100.2, "era": 3.93377515741738, "fip": 3.2307799848941907, "hra": 8, "k_9": 9.65562993184266, "bb_9": 2.32450350211027, "hr_9": 0.71523184680316, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2022_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 3.4067703259082127, "year": "2022", "hr_fb": 0.087912087, "level": "A,A+", "gb_pct": 46.1538461, "lob_pct": 65.862709}, "2023_minors_pit": {"g": 26, "k": 97, "bb": 43, "gs": 25, "ha": 118, "ip": 109.2, "era": 5.66261450701909, "fip": 5.0788486421364425, "hra": 16, "k_9": 7.960487060592054, "bb_9": 3.5288757072727663, "hr_9": 1.3130700306131222, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2023_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 4.314524269594488, "year": "2023", "hr_fb": 0.2, "level": "AA", "gb_pct": 51.070336299999994, "lob_pct": 62.853106999999994}, "2024_minors_pit": {"g": 26, "k": 118, "bb": 35, "gs": 22, "ha": 112, "ip": 127.0, "era": 3.8976377952755907, "fip": 3.803797758658101, "hra": 13, "k_9": 8.362204724409448, "bb_9": 2.4803149606299213, "hr_9": 0.9212598425196851, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2024_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 3.9288162693029314, "year": "2024", "hr_fb": 0.096296296, "level": "AA,AAA", "gb_pct": 43.767313, "lob_pct": 66.76782999999999}}}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 302, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:22:26.863Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:48:01.179Z", "player": "701590", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 297, "tier": null, "note": "A standout athlete and native of Indiana, Stephen spent two seasons at Purdue, working as a reliever as a freshman before moving into the starting rotation as a sophomore.

Lowe didn’t debut professionally until 2023, when he had a productive three-start stint with Low-A Lake Elsinore before shoulder fatigue forced him to the injured list for virtually all of the year. Lowe began 2024 back with Lake Elsinore and pitched his way to High-A Fort Wayne in August. In seven starts at the higher level, he compiled a 4.05 ERA though his command faltered and he did not miss as many bats as he did at Low-A. Lowe is a strong-bodied and physical righthander with a particularly thick lower half. He has a compact delivery and pitches out of a three-quarters slot. Lowe’s fastball sits 92-95 mph, but it has been up to 97 with carry at the top of the zone. His low-80s slider generated an impressive 44% miss rate in 2024 between two levels, and it flashes sharp sweeping life with a bit of depth. It is a plus pitch for which he has an advanced feel, and it is effective against both righthanded and lefthanded hitters. Lowe’s third pitch is an average mid-to-upper-80s changeup which will flash late fade with some tumble. He is an average strike-thrower, though his control will be worth monitoring in 2025 after it took a step back at the end of 2024. A shoulder injury cut Lowe’s 2023 season short, so it was encouraging to see him put together a full and healthy 2024. He is on track to start 2025 with High-A Fort Wayne and could earn a promotion to Double-A San Antonio before the end of the season.

The draft-eligible sophomore signed for an above-slot bonus of $797,500 and joined Thatcher Hurd as one of two Tigers in New York’s pitching-heavy draft haul. He did not pitch after signing. Baseball America ranked him as a second-team college All-American. His career-high 50.1 innings came as a fortuitous time, in long relief duties during the win that sent LSU to super regionals. As is often the case with relievers, Herring’s arsenal is limited. He works with two pitches: a low-90s fastball that peaks at 95 mph and a sweepy slider in the mid 80s. He has a changeup, though it is not expected to be a significant part of his repertoire going forward. He shows more pitchability than most relievers, walked just 13 hitters in 50.1 innings during his second season with LSU and owns an 8.8% career walk rate in college.

After graduating, Pintaro pitched in the independent Pioneer League in 2023 and returned for another stint in 2024. This time, the 26-year-old got noticed. The Mets signed him on June 3 after three starts and assigned him to High-A Brooklyn, where he quickly joined the rotation.

He’s also notably durable, having thrown at least 90 innings in each season since the pandemic, including nearly 100 at his various assignments in 2024. Pintaro leans on his 90 mph cutter and mid-80s slider, but his best single attribute is his unpredictability. He mixes in ample sinkers, changeups and four-seamers to keep hitters guessing. He’s not overpowering but isn’t exactly a soft-tosser, not with 93-95 mph velocity and the ability to reach near 97. Pintaro allowed just three home runs in affiliated ball in 2024, while notching a 53% groundball rate that was topped only by Joey Lucchesi among Mets minor league starters.

Peña has big-time arm speed and attacks from a three-quarters slot out of a low release height. His fastball sits in the upper 90s and has been up to 98 with riding life through the zone. Peña’s best pitch is his low-90s cutter that flashes late glove-side life. It’s effective against both right and lefthanded hitters and he locates it well. The cutter ties up lefties, while it breaks away at the last second against righties. Last season, it held opposing hitters to a .167 average and generated a 36% miss rate. Peña completes his arsenal with a seldom-used power gyro slider in the upper 80s to low 90s.

His changeup is a firm upper-80s offering with unusual shape, which looks like a cut-splitter. It has little vertical or velocity separation from his fastball but was effective when landed in 2024.

He immediately opened eyes in his debut that year in the Dominican Summer League and continued to impress the following season before enduring a horrific injury in the complex league, suffering a compound fracture of his left femur rounding first base. The injury cost him the rest of the season. He returned to the field in 2024 looking like essentially the same player, hitting .276/.362/.432 over 46 games in the complex league before a six-game cameo in Low-A to end the year. With a compact frame and short levers, Barriga has an aggressive approach yet makes enough contact and has shown he can hit the ball harder than expected given his size. He already ranks among the better defensive catchers in the system, pairing receiving skills that are at least average with a double-plus arm that is both powerful and accurate.

Rodden is a switch-hitter but was much more productive from the righthand side of the plate in 2024. He hit for a sneaky amount of power both in college and pro ball. Despite his diminutive stature, he does an excellent job of creating loft, and his below-average raw power is enough to lift balls out of the yard. Rodden doesn’t have the biggest top-end speed, but he’s an overall solid-average runner buoyed by excellent acceleration. The run, acceleration, savvy and strong headfirst slides allow him to be a basestealing threat. Defensively, he splits time between second base, shortstop and third base. His tools, namely average range and a solid but non-elite arm strength, make second base the best fit for him, but he has enough in his bag to cover all three positions. Rodden profiles as a prototype utility infielder capable of filling in at multiple positions. He’s an older prospect relative to his pro experience, but the Mariners have compensated by advancing him at a fairly aggressive pace. He will likely return to Double-A to begin 2025.

Suero is an above-average runner who looks natural in left field and could be a real defensive asset with his versatility. Behind the plate, he has the raw ingredients to be an average defender with a solid-average arm. Suero’s versatility and ability to catch will help him get a foot in the door in MLB.

His primary fastball is a classic two-seamer, sitting 92-93 mph with heavy armside run that he can manipulate the sink on. The fastball has an unusual plane for a sinker with a flat vertical approach angle that adds deception. His primary secondary is his low-80s curveball which is used against both righties and lefties. He mixes in his slider against both sides as well, and it’s a below-average pitch that sits between 83-85 mph. Hicks’ changeup is his best bat-missing pitch and has good separation from the fastball.

Steward’s entire mix plays up because his ball moves all over the place, though his command and control still could use plenty of improvement as he ascends through the minors. Scouts outside the organization would like to see him add some deception to his delivery to make his fastballs—which each sit around 93-95 mph—more difficult to time. Even if he improves the quantity of his strikes, he’s still likely to be control over command. Steward was a pleasant surprise coming out of the draft’s penultimate round. If he can firm up the control of his overpowering stuff, he has a future as a late-inning reliever.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 40, "player_risk": 2, "interesting": false, "stats": {"2023_minors_pit": {"g": 5, "k": 5, "bb": 11, "gs": 0, "ha": 2, "ip": 6.0, "era": 3.0, "fip": 7.686497084299724, "hra": 0, "k_9": 7.5, "bb_9": 16.5, "hr_9": 0.0, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2023_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 8.602052933971088, "year": "2023", "hr_fb": 0.0, "level": "A,CPX", "gb_pct": 57.1428571, "lob_pct": 84.615385}, "2024_minors_pit": {"g": 22, "k": 101, "bb": 50, "gs": 20, "ha": 81, "ip": 102.2, "era": 3.4188309994570747, "fip": 3.9752139979849086, "hra": 5, "k_9": 8.853895665260628, "bb_9": 4.383116665970609, "hr_9": 0.43831166659706083, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2024_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 4.313913590246429, "year": "2024", "hr_fb": 0.059523809, "level": "A,A+", "gb_pct": 45.925925899999996, "lob_pct": 71.641791}}}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 363, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:22:27.127Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:48:01.407Z", "player": "804526", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 437, "tier": null, "note": "Another Blue Jays pitcher who’s shown glimpses of a breakout, Perry’s 2024 season ended after an elbow injury.

The Padres signed him that August. Nett spent much of 2023 in the Arizona Complex League, while reaching Low-A Lake Elsinore for 13 innings and then adding 17 more in the Arizona Fall League. In 2024, Nett reached a career-high 65 innings between High-A Fort Wayne and, briefly, Double-A San Antonio. Nett has an athletic frame with some length in his lower half and strength throughout. He moves well on the mound and features a compact delivery with a short, quick arm stroke and attacks hitters from a three-quarters slot. A former basketball player, Nett’s athleticism is evident in his dynamic movement patterns. His fastball sits in the mid-to-upper 90s and is most effective—and generates the most whiffs—in the top half of the strike zone thanks to its carrying life. Nett’s low-to-mid-80s slider flashes tight sweeping life as well as some depth. In 2024 it generated a 38% miss rate. He rounds out his arsenal with a seldom-used changeup which ranges between the high 80s and low 90s. Nett’s control is fringe-average and his strike-throwing ability can escape him at times. He will need to continue to take positive strides in that department in order to maximize his upside. Nett figures to begin 2025 with Double-A San Antonio, and he could earn a promotion to Triple-A El Paso before the end of the season. Much of Nett’s ceiling hinges on how his command and control progress. At his best, he could be a serviceable No. 4 starter.

Rodriguez walked just 2.7% of the batters he faced in 2024. He repeats a simple, efficient delivery with compact arm action to fill the strike zone with potential plus-plus control, especially of his fastball. His fastball control is among the best in the minors, but the pitch itself is light on velocity. Rodriguez pitches at 88-90 mph, topping out at 92 with bore and cutting action on a high-spin fastball (2,600-2,700 rpm). He consistently executes a tight slider with sharp, late tilt and high spin (2,700-2,800 rpm) at 77-81 mph that flashes above-average and grades out as his best pitch. He throws a shorter cutter at 81-85 mph as well that he will mix into any count. His changeup blends in too closely to his fastball at 83-86 mph and is a below-average pitch.

After 68 innings between San Jose and Eugene, Choate got a bit more experience in the Arizona Fall League and finished the year with 84.1 frames. In 2024, he reached Double-A for the first time. The level showed him the need for further refinement. Choate’s game is based around finesse and deception, and he’ll need to make strength gains to get a couple more ticks of velocity on his arsenal. His fastball averaged around 88 mph and touched 93 in 2024, though it plays up thanks to the deception generated by a lower slot and nearly seven feet of extension. He backs the fastball with a slurvy breaking ball in the mid 70s that plays like a sideways curveball. He ties his mix together with a changeup in the same velocity band as his breaking ball. All together, Choate’s pitches give him options in all quadrants of the strike zone, but his control took a step backward once he reached Double-A.

He’s potentially a candidate to pick up a sinker in the future due to his lower spin efficiency profile. His low-to-mid-80s gyro slider generated a 21.4% swinging-strike rate. Ozuna’s third pitch is a firm, higher-80s changeup for which he shows below-average feel. Ozuna is a young projectable righthander with above-average command of his fastball and slider, but needed development of a third pitch. He has a chance to develop into a No. 4 starter.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 50, "player_risk": 3, "interesting": false, "stats": {"2023_minors_pit": {"g": 14, "k": 32, "bb": 20, "gs": 5, "ha": 30, "ip": 32.1, "era": 4.731959507257443, "fip": 5.338856305517603, "hra": 3, "k_9": 8.90721789601401, "bb_9": 5.567011185008757, "hr_9": 0.8350516777513135, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2023_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 5.078096826753519, "year": "2023", "hr_fb": 0.071428571, "level": "DSL", "gb_pct": 32.5581395, "lob_pct": 69.67213100000001}, "2024_minors_pit": {"g": 10, "k": 45, "bb": 11, "gs": 5, "ha": 35, "ip": 37.0, "era": 4.135135135135135, "fip": 3.669946964367016, "hra": 1, "k_9": 10.945945945945946, "bb_9": 2.675675675675676, "hr_9": 0.24324324324324326, "side": "pitch", "slug": "2024_minors_pit", "type": "minors", "xfip": 4.257828290236963, "year": "2024", "hr_fb": 0.027027027, "level": "CPX", "gb_pct": 43.1578947, "lob_pct": 64.37768200000001}}}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 437, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:22:27.439Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:48:01.647Z", "player": "814299", "wishlist": 1, "rank": 236, "tier": null, "note": "Ferreras is a positionless bat-first infielder with above-average quality of contact and fringy plate skills.

Pecko mixes five pitches: a four-seam fastball, cutter, slider, curveball and changeup. His four-seamer sits 92-93 mph, touches 96 and plays up due to a flat vertical approach angle that helps it miss bats high in the zone. Pecko shows the ability to consistently land the pitch in the upper regions of the zone, driving a 17% swinging-strike rate against the pitch in 2024. His upper-80s cutter is a true cutter that sits 87-88 mph and generates solid whiff rates. Pecko’s primary breaking ball is a low-80s sweeping slider that generates whiffs and grounders. His low-80s curveball is a variation of the slider with greater depth and sees regular usage against lefthanded hitters. Pecko’s changeup is a clear fifth pitch, though it shows solid vertical life and velocity separation from his fastball. Pecko has average command.

Snyder was regarded as one of the most athletic players in the 2024 draft, with a chance to hit and stick at shortstop as his 6-foot-1, 197-pound frame matures. Like many Mets high school draft picks, Snyder is a hit-over-power infielder with bat-to-ball skills, a line-drive approach and control of the strike zone. As his body matures and his swing is optimized, he could unlock more power to become more of an overall average offensive contributor. His fast hands sometimes lead him to become over-eager and not wait for his pitch. Snyder will play shortstop in the low minors because of his ability to read the ball off the bat, take the proper route and throw from different angles with an above-average arm. He is a roughly average runner who may outgrow shortstop and fit better at third base as he develops. Mets area scout Trey Cobb, who left after the season to become Oklahoma State’s director of player development, lauded Snyder’s work ethic.

Coronil’s above-average arm and actions is a favorable recipe for him to stick at shortstop long term, though he could move to the outfield if he eventually outgrows the position. There are some hit tool questions with Coronil, particularly as it pertains to his swing-and-miss, though there is plenty to dream on from an impact and power standpoint as he continues to mature physically. He has a fairly compact swing with present quickness in his hands. Still just 17-years-old, Coronil figures to make his DSL debut this summer which will set the table for his stateside debut in 2026.", "tags": null, "player_type": null, "player_school": null, "player_level": null, "player_year": null, "player_fv": 50, "player_risk": 3, "interesting": false, "stats": null}}, {"model": "npl.wishlistplayer", "pk": 489, "fields": {"active": true, "created": "2025-03-01T00:24:20.226Z", "last_modified": "2025-03-01T00:48:01.853Z", "player": "829069", "wishlist": 1, "rank": null, "tier": null, "note": "At $1.1 million, Rodriguez earned the biggest bonus of any of Texas’ signees in the 2025 international signing class.

His curveball shows sharp, tight break and his changeup is ahead of most of the versions thrown by his peers.
